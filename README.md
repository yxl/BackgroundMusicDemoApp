# Firefox OS Boilerplate App

This is a demo Firefox OS app to show how to play music in the background. The UI is based on [Firefox OS Boilerplate App](https://github.com/robnyman/Firefox-OS-Boilerplate-App) of robnyman.

The music playing is from [http://www.hanhot.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=7732](http://www.hanhot.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=7732) and the copyright belongs to the original author. 

It will give you a button to install it in Firefox OS.
